# Google-Keep
A website similar to Keep notes app. I have done this while learning web Development

Done using React.
You can add or delete notes.

You can create a react app and run it locally.

To create a react app - 

a. Make sure the node version is upto date.

b. Run the command - "npx create-react-app my-app". You can have your own directory name istead of "my-app"

c. To run the app inside the my-app directory, run the command "npx create-react-app my-app".

You can also refer to the following link to create a react app - "https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html"
